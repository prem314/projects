Authors: Anu Gupta, Philipp Seitz, Mathias Hermann, Birgit Esser, R. Naaman
Abstract:

 
 A central challenge in molecular spintronics is to achieve a high spin polarization at low operating voltages and ambient conditions while maintaining good electrical conductivity. Chiral conjugated nanohoops, characterized by their curved and strained

Using magnetic‐conductive atomic force microscopy (mc‐AFM) and magnetoresistance (MR) measurements, asymmetry in spin transport is shown, with temperature‐dependent MR indicating vibrational contributions to spin selectivity. Despite the formation of a supramolecular structure and non‐selective adsorption on the surface, the nanohoops exhibit high spin polarization at ambient temperature and low voltage operation, along with a high conductivity, a rare combination in organic spintronics.

Title: Chiral Acoustic Phonon and Conservation of Pseudoangular Momentum in α-Quartz.
Authors: Changsoo Kim, In-Kook Hwang, Kyoung-Woong Moon, Kyongmo An, Kyung-Jin Lee, Jae-Hyeon Ko, Byong‐Guk Park, Kwang-Yong Choi, Chanyong Hwang
Abstract:
While the linear motion of phonons is widely understood as arising from the translational symmetry of crystal lattices, recent studies have revealed the intrinsic rotational motion of phonons in condensed matter with discrete rotational symmetry. These phonons, termed chiral phonons, carry angular momentum associated with the rotational motion of atomic masses, as well as pseudoangular momentum arising from the phase winding of their circular motion. Chiral phonons give rise to novel physical phenomena such as Weyl phonons, valleytronics, and current-induced spin selectivity. Furthermore, since acoustic phonons are the primary carriers of heat, chiral acoustic phonons are expected to play a significant role in spin caloritronics. However, the existence of chiral acoustic phonons has not yet been demonstrated, in contrast to the chiral optical phonons. In this study, the detection of chiral acoustic phonons is reported using Brillouin light scattering. It is found that the conservation of pseudoangular momentum, which governs the helicity-dependent selection rules in photon-phonon interactions, manifests clearly for chiral acoustic phonons. By probing the previously uncharted low-wavenumber, low-frequency regime of chiral phonon dispersion, the findings expand the understanding of phonon chirality and its potential implications.

Title: Spin polarization driven by molecular vibrations leads to enantioselectivity in chiral molecules
Authors: Shinji Miwa, Tatsuya Yamamoto, Takashi Nagata, S. Sakamoto, Kenta Kimura, Masanobu Shiga, Weiguang Gao, Hiroshi M. Yamamoto, Keiichi Inoue, Taishi Takenobu, T. Nozaki, Tatsuhiko Ohto
Abstract:
Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) encompasses phenomena such as magnetoresistance and enantiomer separation using ferromagnets. It has recently received notable attention. Despite this growing interest, the microscopic mechanisms driving CISS remain a subject of intense debate. This paper complements and extends the prevailing interpretation that attributes CISS primarily to the electric current in chiral molecules. We propose that molecular vibrations drive spin polarization in chiral molecules and play a critical role in CISS. Our results suggest that magnetic interactions between chiral molecules and ferromagnets, analogous to interlayer exchange coupling, provide a physically consistent mechanism for the observed selectivity. Specifically, we demonstrate that molecular vibrations facilitate the alignment of spin angular momentum dependent on chirality in the presence of an external magnetic field, which is a prerequisite for exchange coupling. These findings necessitate reevaluating spin dynamics, expanding its relevance beyond traditional solid-state physics to fields such as chemical reactions, molecular biology, and drug discovery.

Title: Should it really be that hard to model the chirality induced spin selectivity effect?
Authors: J. Fransson
Abstract:
The chirality induced spin selectivity effect remains a challenge to capture with theoretical modeling. While at least a decade was spent on independent electron models, which completely fail to reproduce the experimental results, the lesson to be drawn out of these efforts is that a correct modeling of the effect has to include interactions among the electrons. In the discussion of the phenomenon, one inevitably encounters the Onsager reciprocity and time-reversal symmetry and questions whether the observations violate these fundamental concepts or whether we have not been able to identify what it is that makes those concepts redundant in this context. The experimental fact is that electrons spin-polarize by one or another reason when traversing chiral molecules. The setups are simple enough to enable effective modeling; however, overcoming the grand failures of the theoretical efforts, thus far, and formulating a theory that is founded on microscopic modeling appears to be a challenge. A discussion of the importance of electron correlations is outlined, pointing to possible spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry and Onsager reciprocity.

Title: Photoredox Catalysis with Spin Magnetic Field Effects: A Scheme for Chiral Resolution.
Authors: Yong Rui Poh, A. Koner, Michael Reitz, J. Yuen-Zhou
Abstract:
Quantities that break both mirror symmetry and time-reversal symmetry, such as the orbital angular momentum, are known to connect molecular chirality with an applied magnetic field. This concept has led to observations such as magneto-chiral dichroism and chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). However, being small, these effects often require additional amplification procedures such as flow chemistry to achieve bulk enantioseparation. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnetic field effect on photogenerated radical pairs, which also breaks time-reversal symmetry, can be harnessed for enantiopurification. Fundamental to this process is the collective decay of the singlet and triplet radical-pair states made possible by an applied magnetic field. Because opposite enantiomers exhibit spin-orbit coupling matrix elements of opposite signs, the singlet and triplet decay channels interfere constructively in one enantiomer. Meanwhile, molecules of the other enantiomer are funnelled into the first enantiomer through excited-state chirality inversion, achieving (dynamic kinetic) chiral resolution. Using an axially chiral binaphthyl derivative and a borane photosensitizer as prototype, we predict an appreciable enantiomeric excess (e.e.) of 90% to be possible at steady state, attained within hundreds of milliseconds when irradiated by a laser. Importantly, our analytical results showcase regimes of perfect enantioselectivity (100% e.e.), accessible by further chemical optimization of the photosensitizer for which general strategies are discussed. Overall, this work illustrates a so-far untapped but powerful control knob for photoredox catalysis based on spin chemistry principles.

Title: Knot-Driven Spin Selectivity: Topological Chirality-Induced Robust Spin Polarization in Molecular Knots
Authors: Xi Sun, Kai-Yuan Zhang, Shu-Zheng Zhou, Hua-Hua Fu
Abstract:
Compared to traditional structural chiral materials (e.g., DNA, helicene), topological chirality in trefoil knot molecules has demonstrated multiple remarkable advantages in chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), including ultra-high spin polarization of nearly 90%, conductivity increased by two orders of magnitude, and high-temperature stability (up to 350$^{\circ}$C). However, the underlying physical mechanism remains elusive. This work establishes, for the first time, a fundamental theoretical framework for topological chirality-induced spin selectivity (TCISS) in trefoil knot molecules and identifies the necessary conditions for knot-driven spin selectivity. Our calculation results reveal that a trefoil knot molecule can exhibit spin polarization exceeding 60% along with significant conductivity. Notably, neither reducing the lattice number nor applying strain regulation significantly diminishes this ultra-high spin polarization, highlighting its robustness. Importantly, when the topological knot degenerates into a trivial structure, accompanied by the transition from topological chirality to structural chirality, the spin polarization sharply declines, demonstrating a strong correlation between the ultrahigh spin polarization and the knot topology. Our theory not only successfully elucidates the physical mechanism of TCISS, but also uncovers a new spin-polarized transport phenomenon termed knot-driven spin selectivity, offering new guiding principles for designing nonmagnetic materials for spintronics device applications.

Title: Dynamical theory of chiral-induced spin selectivity in electron donor–chiral molecule–acceptor systems
Authors: Tian-Yi Zhang, Y. Mao, Ai-Min Guo, Qing-Feng Sun
Abstract:
The chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, a phenomenon where the chirality of molecules imparts significant spin selectivity to electron transfer processes, has garnered increasing interest among the chemistry, biology, and physics communities. Although this effect was discovered more than a decade ago, the dynamical process of how electron spin polarization is caused by chiral molecules is still unclear. Here, we propose a dynamical theory of electron transfer in donor-chiral molecule bridge-acceptor systems without electrodes or substrates based on the Lindblad-type master equation. We demonstrate that the molecular spin-orbit coupling generates unequal spin velocities and achieves steady spin polarization with the help of dephasing. Our work elucidates the dynamical process of CISS and may promote the applications of chiral-based spintronic devices.

Title: Chirality-bolstered quantum Zeno effect enhances radical pair-based magnetoreception
Authors: Luke D. Smith, Sukesh Tallapudi, Matt C J Denton, D. Kattnig
Abstract:
Radical pairs in the flavoprotein cryptochrome are central to various magnetically sensitive biological processes, including the proposed mechanism of avian magnetoreception. Cryptochrome's molecular chirality has been hypothesized to enhance magnetic field effects via the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, yet the mechanism underlying this enhancement remains unresolved. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of CISS on the directional magnetic sensitivity of prototypical radical pair reactions, analyzing two distinct models—one generating spin polarization and, for the first time, one generating coherence. We find that CISS-induced spin polarization significantly enhances magnetic sensitivity by introducing triplet character into the initial state and reinforcing the quantum Zeno effect, aligning with enhancements observed in triplet-born radical pairs subject to strongly asymmetric recombination. In contrast, CISS-generated spin coherence does not provide a significant improvement in sensitivity. These findings indicate that CISS is not itself a universal enhancer of sensitivity or coherence in radical pair reactions, and its influence must be evaluated case by case, particularly in relation to the quantum Zeno effect. Additionally, we provide a unified interpolation scheme for modeling CISS-influenced initial states and recombination dynamics, encompassing the principal models currently discussed in the literature for singlet and triplet precursors.

Abstract:
Chiral metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged for the excellent integration of spin states of freedom with optoelectronic properties. The chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect enables chiral MHPs great potential to spin-dependent optoelectronic applications. In this review, we briefly summarize the construction principles and recent discoveries on the CISS effect of chiral MHPs. Then, the room temperature spin light-emitting diodes (spin-LEDs) based on the CISS effect of chiral MHPs are discussed. In the end, challenges and opportunities related to spin-LEDs based on chiral MHPs are proposed.

Title: Chiral Induced Spin Polarized Electron Current: Origin of the Chiral Induced Spin Selectivity Effect
Authors: J. Fransson
Abstract:
The discovery of the chiral induced spin selectivity effect has provided a novel tool to study how active physical and chemical mechanisms may differ in chiral enantiomers; however, the origin of the effect itself is yet an open question. In this Letter, it is theoretically shown that two aspects must be fulfilled for the chiral induced spin selectivity effect to arise. First, chirality is a necessary condition for breaking the spin-degeneracy in molecular structures that do not comprise heavy elements. Second, dissipation is indispensable for the molecule to develop a nonvanishing spin-polarization. These theoretical conclusions are illustrated in terms of a few examples, showing the necessity of the two aspects to be coordinated for the emergence of the chiral induced spin selectivity effect.

Title: Chirality-Induced Majorana Zero Modes and Majorana Polarization.
Authors: Song Chen, Huahua Fu
Abstract:
Realizing Majorana Fermions has always been regarded as a crucial and formidable task in topological superconductors. In this work, we report a physical mechanism and a material platform for realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs). This material platform consists of open circular helix molecule (CHM) proximity coupled with an s-wave superconductor (under an external magnetic field) or interconnected-CHM chain coupled with a phase-bias s-wave superconducting heterostructure (without any external magnetic field). MZMs generated here are tightly associated with the structural chirality in CHMs. Notably, the left- and right-handedness results in completely opposite Majorana polarization (MP), leading us to refer to this phenomenon as chirality-induced MP (CIMP). Importantly, the local CIMP is closely linked to chirality-induced spin polarization, providing us with an effective way to regulate MZMs through the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. Furthermore, MZMs can be detected by the spin-polarized current measurements related to the CISS in chiral materials.

Title: Probing the Roles of Temperature and Cooperative Effects in Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity: Photoelectron Spin Polarization in Helical Tetrapyrroles
Authors: P. Möllers, Adrian J Urban, S. De Feyter, Hiroshi M. Yamamoto, H. Zacharias
Abstract:
We investigate the roles of molecular vibrations and intermolecular interactions in the mechanism underlying chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) in monolayers of helical tetrapyrrole (TPBT) molecules. The spin polarization of photoelectrons emitted from TPBT-functionalized Cu(111) surfaces was measured as a function of the temperature and the surface coverage. We employed DFT calculations to determine the energy and temperature-dependent population of vibrational modes which vary either the molecular pitch and/or the molecular radius. In combination, the data demonstrate that molecular vibrations do not play a significant role for CISS in the TPBT layers. Submonolayer coverages were created by gradual thermal desorption of the molecules from the surface during the spin polarization measurements. While the spin polarization scales nonlinearly with the surface coverage, this behavior can be rationalized entirely through changes of the photoelectron yield upon surface functionalization, and therefore represents no evidence for cooperative effects involved in CISS.

Title: Influence of nonequilibrium vibrational dynamics on spin selectivity in chiral molecular junctions.
Authors: Rudolf Smorka, Samuel L Rudge, Michael Thoss
Abstract:
We explore the role of molecular vibrations in the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect in the context of charge transport through a molecular nanojunction. We employ a mixed quantum-classical approach that combines Ehrenfest dynamics for molecular vibrations with the hierarchical equations of motion method for the electronic degrees of freedom. This approach treats the molecular vibrations in a nonequilibrium manner, which is crucial for the dynamics of molecular nanojunctions. To explore the effect of vibrational dynamics on spin selectivity, we also introduce a new figure of merit, the displacement polarization, which quantifies the difference in vibrational displacements for opposing lead magnetizations. We analyze the dynamics of single trajectories, investigating how the spin selectivity depends on voltage and electronic-vibrational coupling. Furthermore, we investigate the dynamics and temperature dependence of ensemble-averaged observables. We demonstrate that spin selectivity is correlated in time with the vibrational polarization, indicating that the dynamics of molecular vibrations is the driving force of CISS in this model within the Ehrenfest approach.

Title: Spectral density modulation and universal Markovian closure of fermionic environments.
Authors: Davide Ferracin, A. Smirne, S. Huelga, M. Plenio, D. Tamascelli
Abstract:
The combination of chain-mapping and tensor-network techniques provides a powerful tool for the numerically exact simulation of open quantum systems interacting with structured environments. However, these methods suffer from a quadratic scaling with the physical simulation time, and therefore, they become challenging in the presence of multiple environments. This is particularly true when fermionic environments, well-known to be highly correlated, are considered. In this work, we first illustrate how a thermo-chemical modulation of the spectral density allows replacing the original fermionic environments with equivalent, but simpler, ones. Moreover, we show how this procedure reduces the number of chains needed to model multiple environments. We then provide a derivation of the fermionic Markovian closure construction, consisting of a small collection of damped fermionic modes undergoing a Lindblad-type dynamics and mimicking a continuum of bath modes. We describe, in particular, how the use of the Markovian closure allows for a polynomial reduction of the time complexity of chain-mapping based algorithms when long-time dynamics are needed.

Title: Chirality-Induced Majorana Polarization
Authors: Song Chen, Huajuan Fu
Abstract:
To realize Majorana fermions having novel physical features has been developed as a key while difficult task in topological superconductor. Here we have proposed another platform to generate Majorana zero modes (MZMs), which is constructed by a single opened circular helix molecules (CHM) coupled with a s-wave superconductor (with magnetic field) or by an interlinked-CHMs chain coupled with a phase-bias s-wave superconducting heterostructure (without any magnetic field). The MZMs achieved here are tightly associated with the structural chirality in CHMs. Importantly, the left and right handedness may result in completely opposite Majorana polarization (MP), and the local MP is associated to the chiraliy-induced spin polarization. These properties provides us multiple effective ways to detect and regulate the MZMs by using the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect and the related spin-polarized currents in chiral materials.

Title: Persistent Chirality-Induced Spin-Selectivity Effect in Circular Helix Molecules.
Authors: Song Chen, R. Wu, Huahua Fu
Abstract:
The spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the dynamics of the nonequilibrium transport process, and the breaking of time-reversal and space-inversion symmetries have been regarded as key factors for the emergence of chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) and chirality-dependent spin currents in helix molecules. In this work, we demonstrated the generation of persistent CISS currents in various circular single-stranded DNAs and 310-helix proteins for the first time, regardless of whether an external magnetic flux is applied or not. This new CISS effect presents only in equilibrium transport processes, distinct from the traditional CISS observed in nonequilibrium transport processes and linear helix molecules; we term it as the PCISS effect. Notably, PCISS manifests irrespective of whether the SOC is chirality-driven or stems from heavy-metal substrates, making it an efficient way to generate chirality-locked pure spin currents. Our research establishes a novel paradigm for examining the underlying physics of the CISS effect.

Abstract:
We here present a variable-range hopping model to describe the chirality-induced spin selectivity along the DNA double helix. In this model, DNA is considered as a one-dimensional disordered system, where electrons are transported by chiral phonon-assisted hopping between localized states. Owing to the coupling between the electron spin and the vorticity of chiral phonons, electric toroidal monopole appears in the charge-to-spin conductances as a manifestation of true chirality. Our model quantitatively explains the temperature dependence of the spin polarization observed in experiments.

Title: Chiral Induced Spin Selectivity
Authors: B. Bloom, Y. Paltiel, R. Naaman, D. Waldeck
Abstract:
Since the initial landmark study on the chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect in 1999, considerable experimental and theoretical efforts have been made to understand the physical underpinnings and mechanistic features of this interesting phenomenon. As first formulated, the CISS effect refers to the innate ability of chiral materials to act as spin filters for electron transport; however, more recent experiments demonstrate that displacement currents arising from charge polarization of chiral molecules lead to spin polarization without the need for net charge flow. With its identification of a fundamental connection between chiral symmetry and electron spin in molecules and materials, CISS promises profound and ubiquitous implications for existing technologies and new approaches to answering age old questions, such as the homochiral nature of life. This review begins with a discussion of the different methods for measuring CISS and then provides a comprehensive overview of molecules and materials known to exhibit CISS-based phenomena before proceeding to identify structure–property relations and to delineate the leading theoretical models for the CISS effect. Next, it identifies some implications of CISS in physics, chemistry, and biology. The discussion ends with a critical assessment of the CISS field and some comments on its future outlook.

Authors: Yu Zhang, Guangcheng Wang, F. Liu, Zixuan Shang, Tianhao Li, Qian Yang, T. Zhai, Xiaolei Wang
Abstract:
The ability to accurately monitor chiral biological molecules is of great significance for their potential applications in disease diagnosis and virus detection. As the existing chiral detection technologies are mainly relying on an optical method by using left/right circularly polarized light, the universality is low and the operation is complicated. Moreover, large quantity of chiral molecules is required, causing low detection efficiency. Here, a self-assembled monolayer of polypeptides has been fabricated to realize trace detection of chirality based on spin selectivity of photon-electron interaction. We have utilized Kerr technique to detect the rotation angle by the molecular monolayer, which indicates the chirality of polypeptides. The chiral structure of a biological molecule could result in spin-selectivity of electrons and thus influence the interaction between electron spin and light polarization. A Kerr rotation angle of ∼3° has been obviously observed, equivalent to the magneto-optic Kerr effect without magnetic material or magnetic field. Furthermore, we have provided a novel solution to achieve chirality discrimination and amplification simultaneously through an optical fiber. The proposed design is applicable for chiral detection via increasing their differential output signal, which clearly demonstrates a useful strategy toward chirality characterization of biological molecules.

Title: Chirality-dependent persistent spin current in single circular helix molecules
Authors: Song Chen, Huajuan Fu
Abstract:
Since the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) was first observed experimentally, its microscopic mechanism has been continuously explored by the scientific community. Among these investigations, the non-equilibrium effects and the unknown origins of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) have been the central issues discussed in recent years. Here, we have achieved a persistent spin current in different circular single-helix molecule driven by a magnetic field, which is inherently linked to the equilibrium state associated with chirality. Due to its measurement method being different from the transport currents observed in previous experiments, the origin of its spin-orbit coupling can be explored by modifying the substrate with different light and heavy metal elements. Our results demonstrate that a persistent spin current can be observed regardless of whether the SOC originates from the chiral molecule or the substrate. Furthermore, by tuning the direction of the magnetic field, we can achieve a phase transition between trivial and non-trivial chiral persistent spin currents. Our work provides a new perspective and platform for exploring the nature of CISS and controlling the effects of CISS.

Abstract:
The Chirality Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect describes the capability of chiral molecules to act as spin filters discriminating flowing electrons according to their spin state. Within molecular spintronics, efforts are focused on developing chiral-molecule-based technologies to control the injection and coherence of spin-polarized currents. Herein, for this purpose, we study spin selectivity properties of a monolayer of a thioalkyl derivative of a thia-bridged triarylamine hetero[4]helicene chemisorbed on a gold surface. A stacked device assembled by embedding a monolayer of these molecules between ferromagnetic and diamagnetic electrodes exhibits asymmetric magnetoresistance with inversion of the signal according to the handedness of molecules, in line with the presence of the CISS effect. In addition, magnetically conductive atomic force microscopy reveals efficient electron spin filtering even at unusually low potentials. Our results demonstrate that thia[4]heterohelicenes represent key candidates for the development of chiral spintronic devices.

Abstract:
A review is provided here about the thermal effects on optical chirality. To this goal, chiral objects dispersed in an embedding fluid are examined for their magnetoelectric coupling. Thermal effects on several chiral meta-atoms and their ensembles are examined. To this goal, DNA-like helical structures are examined in detail. The mechanical aspect of thermo-elasticity is reviewed along with transverse deformations while drawing analogies from condensed-matter physics. In this respect, the chirality-induced spin selection is reviewed along with the temperature-mediated electron–phonon interactions. A wide range of materials, such as polymers and biological cells, are also examined for temperature effects. A transition temperature delineating a sign flip in the chirality parameter is identified as well. Chirality-associated functionalities such as ratchet motions, switching, and modulations are investigated for their respective thermal effects. Issues of fabricating chiral meta-atoms are also discussed.

Abstract:
We demonstrate the possibility of a coupling between the magnetization direction of a ferromagnet and the tilting angle of adsorbed achiral molecules. To illustrate the mechanism of the coupling, we analyze a minimal Stoner model that includes Rashba spin-orbit coupling due to the electric field on the surface of the ferromagnet. The proposed mechanism allows us to study magnetic anisotropy of the system with an extended Stoner-Wohlfarth model and argue that adsorbed achiral molecules can change magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the substrate. Our research aims to motivate further experimental studies of the current-free chirality induced spin selectivity effect involving both enantiomers.

Title: Electronic and spin states at edges of finite p-orbital helical atomic chain.
Authors: T. Kato, Y. Utsumi, O. Entin-Wohlman, A. Aharony
Abstract:
In connection to the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect, we theoretically analyze the electronic and spin states of edges of a finite p-orbital helical atomic chain with the intra-atomic spin-orbit interaction. This model can host the spin-filtering state in which two up-spins propagate in one direction and two down-spins propagate in the opposite direction without breaking the time-reversal symmetry (TRS). The enhancement of charge modulations concentrated at the edges due to the evanescent states is induced, although the spin density is absent because of the TRS. A Zeeman field at an edge of the atomic chain, which breaks the TRS, yields a finite spin polarization, whose direction depends on the chirality of the molecule. The chirality change induces a reasonable amount of the energy difference, which may provide an insight into the enantioselective adsorption of chiral molecules on the ferromagnetic surface.

Title: Spin-Dependent Destructive and Constructive Quantum Interference Associated with Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity in Single Circular Helix Molecules.
Authors: Son-Hsien Chen, H. Fu
Abstract:
Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect in straight helical molecules has received intense studies in past decade; however, the CISS effect in circular helical molecules (CHMs) has still rarely been explored. Here, we have constructed single CHMs having chirality-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and connected by two nonmagnetic leads and successfully gained the required conditions for CISS effect occurring in CHMs for the first time. Our results uncover that only when the CHMs form a closed loop and when the lattice positions are coupled asymmetrically with both leads does the CISS effect occur. More importantly, the CISS-associated spin-dependent destructive and constructive quantum interference (QI) together with their phase transition appears in CHMs. The combination of CISS effect and spin-dependent QI phenomena opens up a new door to understand the underlying physics of the CISS effect in helical molecules.

Title: Floquet-engineered chiral-induced spin selectivity.
Authors: N. Phuc
Abstract:
The control of electron spin, crucial to the stability of matter, offers new possibilities for manipulating the properties of molecules and materials with potential applications in spintronics and chemical reactions. Recent experiments have demonstrated that electron transmission through chiral molecules depends on the electron spin orientation, a phenomenon known as chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS). In this study, we show that CISS can be observed in achiral systems driven by an external circularly polarized laser field in the framework of Floquet engineering. By using the Floquet theory for a time-periodically driven system to investigate spin-dependent electron transport in a two-terminal setup, we demonstrate that the spin polarization can approach unity if the light intensity is sufficiently strong, the rate of dephasing is sufficiently low, and the average chemical potential of the two leads is within an appropriate range of values, which is narrow because of the high frequency of the laser field. To obtain a broader range of energies for large spin polarization, a combination of chiral molecules and light-matter interactions is considered, and the spin polarization of electrons transported through a helical molecule driven by a laser field is evaluated.

Title: Spin polarization induced by decoherence in a tunneling one-dimensional Rashba model
Authors: S. Varela, M. Peralta, V. Mujica, B. Berche, Ernesto Antonio Medina Dagger
Abstract:
Basic questions on the nature of spin polarization in two terminal systems and the way in which decoherence breaks Time-Reversal Symmetry (TRS) are analyzed. We exactly solve several one-dimensional models of tunneling electrons and show the interplay of spin precession and decay of the wavefunction in either a U(1)U(1) magnetic field or an effective Spin-Orbit (SO) magnetic field. Spin polarization is clearly identified as the emergence of a spin component parallel to either magnetic field. We show that Onsager’s reciprocity is fulfilled when time reversal symmetry is present and no spin polarization arises, no matter the barrier parameters or the SO strength. Introducing a Büttiker’s decoherence probe, that preserves unitarity of time evolution, we show that breaking of TRS results in a strong spin polarization for realistic SO, and barrier strengths. We discuss the significance of these results as a very general scenario for the onset of the Chiral-Induced Spin Selectivity effect (CISS).
