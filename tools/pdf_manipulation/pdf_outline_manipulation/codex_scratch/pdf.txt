                  Perturbative master equations are essential for modeling open quantum systems but often exhibit late-time
               divergences when environmental correlations decay algebraically. In this work, we analyze the time-
               convolutionless (TCL) master equation expanded to order TCL2n and demonstrate that, while van Kampen’s
               cumulants suppress early-time secular growth, they ultimately diverge at long times. To overcome this, we
               introduce a resummation technique based on the Hadamard trick, which incorporates time integrals directly

ically, while some matrix elements exhibit exponential decay
(associated with relaxation), others exhibit superexponential
growth due to the exponential growth of the generator,–a
phenomenon we refer to as secular inflation. This unphysical
growth presents a fundamental problem of the resummation,
as it contradicts the unitarity of the combined system and
environment.
    To illustrate this phenomenon, we consider a simplified toy
model that captures key aspects of a more complex behavior in
the TCL master equation. In this example, the system exhibits
four complex frequencies: ω = ±1 ± 0.15i. Our goal is to
compute the time-dependent spectral density using Eq. (21).
    Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show Re ω (t ) for ω = −1 ± 0.15i,
represented by the solid red lines. The dashed black lines
indicate the asymptotic spectral density (t → ∞), Re ω , ob-
tained by analytical continuation of Eq. (24) from the real
axis. For frequencies with Im ω = 0.15i, the spectral density
smoothly approaches the analytic continuation. In contrast,
for frequencies with Im ω = −0.15i, the spectral density fails
to reach the analytic continuation due to increasing oscillation
amplitudes over time. The average value of these oscillations
corresponds to the analytic continuation represented by the
dashed line.
    Specifically, when Im ω < 0, Eq. (25) explicitly demon-
strates this growth. However, the asymptotic limit described                    FIG. 1. Real-part time-dependent spectral density at complex

As with the TCL4 case, we substitute the time arguments of us and uv with t, making their time dependence implicit. This
expression is then converted into the Schrödinger picture, following the same approach used for the TCL4 generator.
   By comparing the result with Eqs. (102)–(105), we identify the conditions for leading growth: ω = ωuv + ωvi = ωui , and
either ω = ωkq + ωsu or ω = ωqs + ωsu = ωqu . The prevailing growth occurs when ω = ω = 0, leading to the condition for
dominant growth:
                             {u = i and [(k = u and q = s) or (k = q and u = s)]} or (u = i and q = u).                                               (124)

    The oscillations in the longitudinal magnetization persist
because of the second derivative of the time-dependent spec-
tral density, which does not tend to a limit as t → ∞. The
peak-to-peak amplitude of the oscillations is proportional to
λ6 . We also verified that at late times, sz (t ) becomes in-
dependent of the initial state, to a high degree of precision.
Therefore, the dynamics loses the Markovian limit not by
retaining memory of the initial state but by remembering the
initial time when the system and environment were initialized
in a factorized state.

the oscillations decay over time but never fully converge,

remaining mostly constant.

the complexity is divided by (N/ 2)n , and since N  2,                                  with a TCL2n string, the expected number of strings generated
the algorithm always provides exponential speedup for any n.                             total after the kth recursion is thus
This is very significant.

We know gs and ls lie somewhere among β1 , β2 , . . . , β2n− j−1 . We will assume (without justification) that gs and ls are equally
likely to be any one of these digits. Then the probability we need to split this string at this recursion is the probability that both
the gs and ls are amongst the 2n − 2 j nonfixed digits7 :

valid for n ⩾ 3 (see Footnote 7). Plotting (n, log2 (mn )) for 3 ⩽ n ⩽ 200, and performing a linear regression, we find that mn
grows as
                                                  mn ∼ 2−0.133685 × 20.506474n ≈ 0.911 × 1.42n .
Hence, to a good approximation, mn grows with n as 2n/2 . This is exponentially better than a worst case of 2n , but still, the
number of terms grows exponentially with n.

   The Hadamard trick on the time-ordered cumulants was implemented following the methods described in Appendix C, using
scripts and by human labor. Further information is available in [96]. The expansion of TCL6 into time-ordered cumulants after
the Hadamard trick is given as follows:

They are irreducible in the sense that they introduce new functions, which cannot be analytically expressed in terms of the BCF
or . Given that F̃, C̃, and R̃ incorporate two correlation functions, their growths are suppressed relative to the algebraic terms in
Eqs. (G5)–(G7), which are in the growth algebra of Sec. V C. The suppression of growth in F̃, C̃, and R̃ was analyzed in Ref. [20]
and further discussion of such terms will not be pursued, as they are subleading. However, they may need to be revisited for
other resummations in future.
   When the sum ω = ω1 + ω2 + ω3 in the algebraic terms in (G5)–(G7) equals zero, it becomes essential to examine the
limit ω → 0, which introduces the derivative ∂ ω (t )/∂ω. The analysis proceeds by imposing the condition ω1 + ω2 + ω3 = 0
across the 16 instances of F, C, or R in Eqs. (G1)–(G4), followed by the collection and organization of the resulting terms.

   Take the initial occurrence of Fcb,ci,ac (t ) found on Eq. (G1). The condition being enforced is ωcb + ωci + ωac = ωcb + ωai =
0. Two sets of indices exist: (c = b and a = i) or (c = i and b = a). The intersections of the sets must be counted once. The
