abstract = {The time-convolutionless projection operator method is used to investigate the non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems. On the basis of this method a systematic perturbation expansion for the reduced density matrix equation is obtained involving a time-dependent generator which is local in time. This formalism is generalized to enable the treatment of system-environment correlations in the initial state, which arise in the computation of equilibrium correlation functions or from the preparation of the system by a quantum measurement. The general method is illustrated by means of the damped harmonic oscillator and of the spin-boson model. The perturbation expansion of the equation of motion is applied to a study of relaxation and dephasing processes and to the determination of the stationary state and of equilibrium correlation functions. Special emphasis is laid on the construction of general, computable error estimates which allow the explicit validation of the obtained results. In particular, the parameter regime for which an expansion of the equation of motion to fourth order yields reliable results is determined. The results clearly reveal that a large range of physically relevant parameters, in particular those that might be interesting for experiments on macroscopic quantum coherence phenomena, can already be treated using the expansion to fourth order. It is thus demonstrated that the time-convolutionless projection operator technique provides a transparent and technically feasible method to go beyond the Markovian approximation in the study of open quantum systems.}

    abstract = {A novel scheme for the steady state solution of the standard Redfield quantum master equation is developed which yields agreement with the exact result for the corresponding reduced density matrix up to second order in the system-bath coupling strength. We achieve this objective by use of an analytic continuation of the off-diagonal matrix elements of the Redfield solution towards its diagonal limit. Notably, our scheme does not require the provision of yet higher order relaxation tensors. Testing this modified method for a heat bath consisting of a collection of harmonic oscillators we assess that the system relaxes towards its correct coupling-dependent, generalized quantum Gibbs state in second order. We numerically compare our formulation for a damped quantum harmonic system with the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism: we find good agreement at low temperatures for coupling strengths that are even larger than expected from the very regime of validity of the second-order Redfield quantum master equation. Yet another advantage of our method is that it markedly reduces the numerical complexity of the problem; thus, allowing to study efficiently large-sized system Hilbert spaces.},

An analytical expression for this mean force Gibbs state (MFGS) is known in the ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime for the Caldeira–Leggett (CL) model that assumes a harmonic environment. Here, we derive analytical expressions for the MFGS in the USC regime for more general SE models. For all the generalized models considered here, we find the USC state to be diagonal in the basis set by the SE interaction, just like in the CL case. While for the generic model considered, the corresponding USC-MFGS is found to alter from the CL result, we do identify a class of models more general than the CL model for which the CL-USC result remains unchanged. We also provide numerical verification for our results. These results provide key tools for the study of strong coupling quantum thermodynamics and several quantum chemistry and biology problems under more realistic SE models, going beyond the CL model.}",

    abstract = {The dynamical convergence of a system to the thermal distribution, or Gibbs state, is a standard assumption across all of the physical sciences. The Gibbs state is determined just by temperature and energies of the system. However, at decreasing system sizes, i.e., for nanoscale and quantum systems, the interaction with their environments is not negligible. The question then arises: Is the system's steady state still the Gibbs state? If not, how may the steady state depend on the interaction details? Here, we provide an overview of recent progress on answering these questions. We expand on the state of the art along two general avenues: First, we take the static point-of-view, which postulates the so-called mean force Gibbs state. This view is commonly adopted in the field of strong coupling thermodynamics, where modified laws of thermodynamics and nonequilibrium fluctuation relations are established on the basis of this modified state. Second, we take the dynamical point of view, originating from the field of open quantum systems, which examines the time-asymptotic steady state within two paradigms. We describe the mathematical paradigm, which proves return to equilibrium, i.e., convergence to the mean force Gibbs state, and then discuss a number of microscopic physical methods, particularly master equations. We conclude with a summary of established links between statics and equilibration dynamics and provide an extensive list of open problems. This comprehensive overview will be of interest to researchers in the wider fields of quantum thermodynamics, open quantum systems, mesoscopic physics, statistical physics, and quantum optics and will find applications whenever energy is exchanged on the nanoscale, from quantum chemistry and biology to magnetism and nanoscale heat management.},

	abstract = {Understanding better the dynamics and steady states of systems strongly coupled to thermal baths is a great theoretical challenge with promising applications in several fields of quantum technologies. Among several strategies to gain access to the steady state, one consists in obtaining approximate expressions of the mean force Gibbs state, the reduced state of the global system-bath thermal state, largely credited to be the steady state. Here, we present analytical expressions of corrective terms to the ultrastrong coupling limit of the mean force Gibbs state, which has been recently derived. We find that the first order term precisely coincides with the first order correction obtained from a dynamical approach—master equation in the strong-decoherence regime. This strengthens the identification of the reduced steady state with the mean force Gibbs state. Additionally, we also compare our expressions with another recent result obtained from a high temperature expansion of the mean force Gibbs state. We observe numerically a good agreement for ultra strong coupling as well as for high temperatures. This confirms the validity of all these results. In particular, we show that, in term of coherences, all three results allow one to sketch the transition from ultrastrong coupling to weak coupling.Quanta 2022; 11: 53–71.},

journal = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical},
abstract = {We consider the global thermal state of classical and quantum harmonic oscillators that interact with a reservoir. Ohmic damping of the oscillator can be exactly treated with a 1D scalar field reservoir, whereas general non-Ohmic damping is conveniently treated with a continuum reservoir of harmonic oscillators. Using the diagonalized Hamiltonian of the total system, we calculate a number of thermodynamic quantities for the damped oscillator: the mean force internal energy, mean force free energy, and another internal energy based on the free-oscillator Hamiltonian. The classical mean force energy is equal to that of a free oscillator, for both Ohmic and non-Ohmic damping no matter how strong the coupling to the reservoir. In contrast, the quantum mean force energy depends on the details of the damping and diverges for strictly Ohmic damping. These results give additional insight into the steady-state thermodynamics of open systems with arbitrarily strong coupling to a reservoir, complementing results for energies derived within dynamical approaches (e.g. master equations) in the weak-coupling regime.}

abstract="A central assumption in macroscopic thermodynamics is the weak coupling approximation, which posits that the equilibrium properties of a system are not influenced by the interactions with its surrounding environment. However, for nanoscale systems, interactions appearing in the total Hamiltonian may be comparable in magnitude to the systems own internal energy. The presence of non-negligible interactions can alter the system's equilibrium state, causing deviations from the standard Gibbs distribution. This motivates alternative statistical mechanical definitions of the thermodynamic potentials, such as the free energy and entropy, which can be achieved through an identification of the system's Hamiltonian of mean force. This operator provides an effective thermodynamic description of the system both in and away from equilibrium, taking into account the strength of coupling with the environment. Here we give an overview of the properties of this operator, and demonstrate its usefulness in extending thermodynamics to the strong-coupling regime in both quantum and classical systems.",

abstract = {In a recent paper (2004 J.Stat.Mech.:Theor.Exp. P07006), Cohen and Mauzerall (CM) have argued that the derivation of the nonequilibrium work relation given in a previous work of Jarzynski (1997 Phys.Rev.Lett.78 2690) is flawed. Here I attempt to answer their criticisms, both by presenting a detailed version of that derivation and by addressing specific objections raised by CM. The derivation presented here is in fact somewhat stronger than the one I gave in 1997, as it does not rely on the assumption of a weak coupling term connecting the system of interest and its thermal environment.}

Various new physical realizations of these phenomena are discussed, with a focus on their role for electronic transport and quantum dissipation in coupled nano-scale systems like quantum dots. A number of theoretical tools such as Master equations, polaron transformations, correlation functions, or level statistics are used to describe recent work on dissipative charge qubits (double quantum dots), the Dicke effect, phonon cavities, single oscillators, dark states and adiabatic control in quantum transport, and large spin-boson models. The review attempts to establish connections between concepts from Mesoscopics (quantum transport, coherent scattering, quantum chaos), Quantum Optics (such as superradiance, dark states, boson cavities), and (in its last part) Quantum Information Theory.}

abstract = {The generation of coherent light (lasers and masers) forms the basis of a large optics industry. Liu et al. demonstrate a type of laser that is driven by the tunneling of single electrons in semiconductor double-quantum dots. Distinct from other existing semiconductor lasers, the emission mechanism is driven by tunneling of single charges between discrete energy levels that are electrically tunable. The ability to tune the levels by single-electron charging would allow their laser (or maser) to be turned on and off rapidly. Science, this issue p. 285 A coherent microwave source that is driven by the tunneling of single electrons is demonstrated. The coherent generation of light, from masers to lasers, relies upon the specific structure of the individual emitters that lead to gain. Devices operating as lasers in the few-emitter limit provide opportunities for understanding quantum coherent phenomena, from terahertz sources to quantum communication. Here we demonstrate a maser that is driven by single-electron tunneling events. Semiconductor double quantum dots (DQDs) serve as a gain medium and are placed inside a high-quality factor microwave cavity. We verify maser action by comparing the statistics of the emitted microwave field above and below the maser threshold.}}

The donor/acceptor probability dynamics describes transport reactions in chemical processes in presence of a noisy environment - such as the electron transfer in a photosynthetic reaction center. Besides being rigorous, our analysis has the advantages over previous ones that (1) we include a general, non energy-conserving system-environment interaction, and that (2) we allow for the donor or acceptor to consist of multiple energy levels lying closely together. We establish explicit expressions for the rates and the efficiency (final donor-acceptor population difference) of the reaction. In particular, we show that the rate increases for a multi-level acceptor, but the efficiency does not.},

Each spin experiences the same environment interaction, consisting of an energy conserving and an energy exchange part. We find the decay rates of the reduced density matrix elements in the energy basis. We show that if the spins do not interact among each other, then the fastest decay rates of off-diagonal matrix elements induced by the energy conserving interaction is of order N2, while that one induced by the energy exchange interaction is of the order N only. Moreover, the diagonal matrix elements approach their limiting values at a rate independent of N. For a general spin system the decay rates depend in a rather complicated (but explicit) way on the size N and the interaction between the spins. Our method is based on a dynamical quantum resonance theory valid for small, fixed values of the couplings. We do not make Markov-, Born- or weak coupling (van Hove) approximations.}
